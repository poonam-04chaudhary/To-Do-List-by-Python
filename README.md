# To-Do-List-by-Python
This Python program is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager that helps users organize their tasks using object-oriented programming principles. It is composed of two main classes: Task and ToDoList. The Task class represents an individual task, holding details like its description and status (either "Pending" or "Done"), and includes methods to update the description or mark the task as completed. The ToDoList class manages a collection of these tasks, allowing users to add new tasks, view all current tasks, update a task (by changing its description or marking it as done), and delete tasks as needed.
The program runs in a loop, presenting the user with a menu of options to choose from, such as adding a task, viewing tasks, updating a task, deleting a task, or exiting the application. When a user chooses to update a task, they can either change the description or mark it as done. Each action is followed by appropriate feedback messages to guide the user. The use of object-oriented design makes the program modular, readable, and easy to extend. This application is ideal for users who want a basic and interactive way to manage daily tasks through the command line.
